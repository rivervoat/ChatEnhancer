#Voat ChatEnhancer

Ideas for new features for Voat chat, implemented. Not affiliated with Voat.

## Basically:

There are a lot of features that would be really cool to have in Voat chat. This adds a selection of them now, with the hopeof convincing of the value of some of these features (rather than just trying to foist them on the codebase) so as time goes on some of them are integrated.

This is done because /user/river was bored, but also because, for small sized communities where the text isnt flying by there is a lot of potential in having a nice featured live chat - especially for live events.
